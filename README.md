# Express.js-eCommerce-Platform
This project aims to build an eCommerce platform using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose ORM. The platform allows users to browse, search, filter, and sort products. Users can register, authenticate, manage their profiles, and perform CRUD operations on products they own.
